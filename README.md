# Case Study: Modeling Self-Perceived Health and Longevity with SHARE Dataset

## Introduction

In this case study, we tackle a data modeling challenge using the SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) dataset. Participants are provided a rich `statisticsexp.csv` file containing **thousands of variables** (approximately 3,000 features) spanning multiple European countries and survey waves. The goal is to uncover the most influential factors for two key outcomes among older adults: **(1) Self-Perceived Health** (how individuals rate their health) and **(2) Age** (used here as a proxy for longevity). We will develop separate models for each target and carefully interpret which predictors drive these outcomes.  

### Key Objectives and Requirements

- **Dual Targets:** Build models for *self-rated health* (categorical) and *age* (continuous).  
- **Feature Selection with Causality in Mind:** Identify predictors that plausibly **influence** health or longevity and **avoid tautology** (e.g., don’t use other health-outcome indicators to predict self-rated health).  
- **Leverage Panel Structure:** Exploit the longitudinal, multi-country design of SHARE.  
- **Apply Diverse Methods:** Logistic regression, CHAID, random forest, SVM, Bayesian networks, etc.  
- **Deliver a Reproducible Analysis:** A single Jupyter Notebook with code, EDA, models, visuals, and interpretations following a clear workflow (e.g., CRISP-DM).

## Dataset Overview and Preparation

- **Dataset:** `statisticsexp.csv`  
- **Coding Reference:** See `Coding tables.xlsx` for variable meanings.  
- **Targets:**  
  - **Self-Perceived Health** – categorical (e.g., Excellent → Poor).  
  - **Age** – continuous (proxy for longevity).  

### Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Handle Missing Data** (drop, impute, or flag).  
2. **Remove Redundant/Leaky Features** to prevent circular reasoning.  
3. **Feature Selection – Causal Relevance** (demographics, SES, lifestyle, social factors, etc.).  
4. **Encode & Transform** (one-hot, scaling, log transforms, etc.).  
5. **Outlier Handling** (reasonable age range, numeric caps).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Distributions** of health categories and age.  
- **Country & Time Effects** (bar charts, pivots).  
- **Correlation Checks** (age vs health, exercise vs health).  
- **Longevity Factors** (compare 80+ vs 50-60 groups).  

Key findings (examples): country differences, strong positive link between exercise & health, age gradient on health, female survival advantage, education and smoking patterns.

## Feature Selection & Avoiding Tautology

- **Exclude Outcome Indicators** (ADL limitations, chronic disease, etc.) in health model.  
- **Exclude Direct Age Proxies** (birth year, explicit age codes) in age model.  
- **Focus on Causal Factors** (education, income, physical activity, social support).  
- **Bidirectional Variables** (exercise, BMI) retained with caution.  
- **Dimension Reduction** via LASSO, RF-importance, etc.

## Leveraging the Panel Data Structure

- **Country Dummies / Language of Questionnaire** capture cultural effects.  
- **Wave Effects** considered carefully (avoid temporal leakage).  
- **Individual-level Splits** in train/test to respect repeat respondents.  
- **Dynamic Features** possible (lagged variables) but optional.  

Panel data methods help *“control for unobserved variables and capture dynamic relationships”*.

Evaluation metrics: accuracy/F1/AUC for health; MAE/R² for age.

## Results and Interpretation of Findings

Major consistent factors should be presented in the following format:

| Factor | Health Impact | Longevity Impact | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------------------|-------|

## Methodological Notes and Best Practices

1. **Structured Workflow** → CRISP-DM phases ensure completeness.  
2. **Prevent Leakage** → strictly remove leaky features.  
3. **Panel Handling** → country/time controls; clustered splits.  
4. **Reproducibility** → notebook modular, seeds set, markdown explanations.

## Conclusion

Using the SHARE dataset, we demonstrated end-to-end modeling of self-perceived health and longevity. **Lifestyle (exercise), socioeconomic status (education, income), social support, and cultural context** all emerged as crucial. By rigorously avoiding tautology and leveraging panel structures, we produced interpretable insights and reproducible code in a single Jupyter Notebook. This framework can guide future work on healthy aging and similar high-dimensional panel datasets.
